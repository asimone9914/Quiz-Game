# Quiz Game GUI
A simple quiz game built with Python, using the Tkinter library for a simple GUI.

This application supports custom questions and answers through the use of CSV (comma-separated values) files.

The file can be formatted as such:
```
ln.|
  1| question, answer1, answer2, answer3
  2| Who plays jack in The Shining?, Jack Nicholson
  3| Where is the Empire State Building located?, New York, New York City
```
> You may notice there are spaces in this file. 
> Normally, that is not the way to format a CSV file, however
> for ease of use and readability, spaces are okay in this program.

**THIS APPLICATION IS IN A VERY EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT**

## THINGS TO CHANGE:
- About program button has no function
- No message if answer is wrong
- Correct answer message is annoying
- No exit quiz button (must use window close)
- Num. of correct answers not displayed at the end
- Ability to use enter button to submit answers
